With Dr. Fletcher at the Edgerton Center, I'm working on developing a mobile game that
assesses certain neurocognitive functions through minigames. The UROP utilizes Unity
for game development and coding in C#, and could have clinical applications when finished.

With the MIT Wargaming Lab, I am working to help digitize their Taiwan Invasion Scenario wargame
for release on Steam. This UROP uses Unity and C# to create the game, and my responsibilities
include implementing new mechanics and updating UI assets as needed.
